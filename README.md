# EDA-On-FIFA

Our FIFA World Cup prediction project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to a team's success in the tournament. By analyzing historical data from past World Cup matches, we have gained insights into the performance of different teams and identified key features that are predictive of success.
Using the insights gained from our EDA, we engineered new features that were more predictive of a team's success in the World Cup. For example, we created a feature that calculated a team's average possession time or their accuracy in passing the ball.

We then built a machine learning model to predict a team's success in the World Cup based on the factors we had identified. We used techniques like logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines to build a predictive model that took into account the complex interactions between different features.

# Takeaways

Sure, here's an example takeaway for a FIFA World Cup prediction project:

Data Insight: Our FIFA World Cup prediction project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to a team's success in the tournament. By analyzing historical data from past World Cup matches, we can gain insights into the performance of different teams and identify key features that are predictive of success.

EDA: Exploratory data analysis is an essential step in understanding the relationships between different features and team performance in the World Cup. We can use techniques like data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data, such as how a team's performance varies by their FIFA ranking, the number of goals they score per game, and their historical record in previous tournaments.

Feature Engineering: After gaining insights from our EDA, we can engineer new features that may be more predictive of a team's success in the World Cup. For example, we may create a feature that calculates a team's average possession time or their accuracy in passing the ball.

Model Building: With our engineered features, we can build a machine learning model to predict a team's success in the World Cup based on the factors we have identified. We can use techniques like logistic regression, random forests, or support vector machines to build a predictive model that takes into account the complex interactions between different features. By refining our model with real-time data during the tournament, we can provide more accurate predictions and insights into the factors that contribute to a team's success in the World Cup.
